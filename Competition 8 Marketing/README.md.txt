# Problem Statement
Given the recent history of a user's interactions with previous email campaigns, can you predict the success of the next one? This is a common business problem, but one that it is usually hard to find real, publicly accessible datasets for.

## Background

The aim of this project is to build a model that can predict whether a user opens the emails sent by Shopee.

Sending emails is one of the marketing channels Shopee uses to reach out to our users. Being able to predict whether a user opens an email allows Shopee to forecast and evaluate the performance of future marketing campaigns before launch. This is because when a user opens an email, the probability of the user knowing the campaign increases and this in turn increases the probability of the user making a checkout during the campaign period. Therefore, with the predicted open rates, Shopee can better develop, strategize and implement future marketing campaigns.
